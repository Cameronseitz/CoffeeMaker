## Overview
CoffeeMaker is a website that lets customers order beverages from a proposed store. Users can create their own account upon entering the site or sign in if they already have one. Employees can add new ingredients in the inventory, increase the supply of the inventory, make new menu items, and fulfill customer orders. Customers can place orders and pick them up once they are ordered. The backend is written in Java using Spring Boot and the frontend using HTML and AngularJS. The project as a whole is managed by Maven. 

## How to Run
1. Create application.yml from the template in the resources folder.
2. Open the CoffeeMaker folder in Eclipse or other IDE and run CoffeeMakerApplication as a Java Application
3. The page will be at localhost on port 8080
